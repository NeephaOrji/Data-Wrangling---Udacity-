## Summary of Findings


Dog stage with the most likes in descending order are; puppo-doggo, puppo, doggo, floffer-doggo, floffer, doggo-pupper, none, pupper.

Dog stage with the most retweets in descending order are; puppo-doggo, doggo, puppo, floffer, doggo-pupper, floffer-doggo, none, pupper.

Most source tweet was shared from an iphone, followed by Twitter web client and tweet deck.

There is a positive relationship between retweets and likes.

## Limitations 

One major limitation of this analysis is reduction in sample size due to missing values.

A tweet source was lost in the process of cleaning.
